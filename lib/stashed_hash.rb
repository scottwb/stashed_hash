    # ====Parameters
    #
    # +col_name+::
    #   The name of the column, as a Symbol or String, to treat as a
    #   "stashed hash".
    #
    # +options+::
    #   An optional Hash of options, supporting the following members:
    #
    #     :initial => The initial value to assign to the stashed hash
    #                 column when a new object is created. Defaults to
    #                 an empty Hash. This will be overridden by parameters
    #                 to the 'new' or 'create' class methods that explicitly
    #                 set this value.

      # REVISIT: This code to validate the columns is problematic because
      #          running the migration to add this column when the code
      #          that calls this already exists, will always fail. I am
      #          just commenting this out for now until I have some time
      #          to think of a better way to do some run-time validation.

        #    obj.get_stash("sports/baseball/stats/RBIs")

        #
        # This method is really just for convenience. For example, you may

        # key path that you can easily pass to both set_stash and
        # get_stash methods.
        #
        # ====Parameters
        #
        # +key+::
        #   The key of the hash value to get. This should be a String, and
        #   may be delimited into sections with forward-slashes, sort of like
        #   a file path. When slashes are present, this key is treated as a
        #   nested hash key.
        #
        # ====Returns
        #
        # The value found in the stash as the specified key, or +nil+
        # if it was not found.

        # Deletes the value stored in the stashed hash at the specified +key+.

        # This supports nested hash keys. Calling:
        #
        #   obj.del_stash("sports/baseball/stats/RBIs")
        #
        # is equivalent to:
        #
        #    s = obj.stash['sports']['baseball']['stats']
        #    s.delete('RBIs')
        #    obj.stash = s

        #   a file path. When slashes are present, this key is treated as
        #   a nested hash key.
        #
        # ====Returns
        #

        # REVISIT: This is done with wonton disregard for concurrency and
        #          replication latency issues. Eventually when we also
        #          keep a version column, this should:
        #            * Note the current value.
        #            * Perform an OCC-style update.
        #            * Catch a version collision.
        #            * Reload at least this column, if not whole object.
        #            * Test to see if keyed value changed with version change.
        #            * If not, retry.
        #            * If so, raise exception for caller to resolve conflict.
        #
        # REVISIT: Might want to make a version of this that takes an
        #          array of key/value pairs to set all in one save.
        #
        # ====Parameters
        #
        # +key+::
        #   The key of the hash member to set. This should be a String, and
        #   may be delimited into sections with forward-slashes, sort of like
        #   a file path. When slashes are present, this key is treated
        #   as a nested hash key. For example, a key specified as:
        #
        #     "sports/baseball/stats/RBIs"
        #
        #   will actually set the value of:

        #
        #   member, where 'sports', 'baseball', and 'stats' are all

        #
        # +value+::
        #   The value to set at the specified key.

        #
        # ====Parameters
        #
        # +key+::
        #   The key of the hash member to modify. This should be a String,
        #   and may be delimited into sections with forward-slashes, sort of
        #   like a file path. When slashes are preset, this key is treated

        #
        #     obj.stash['sports']['baseball']['stats']['RBIs']
        #
        # +func+::
        #   A lambda Proc function to invoke to modify the data.
        #   This Proc takes in the current value and returns the new value
        #   to nest set. IMPORTANT: This block should have no side-effects,
        #   as it may be executed multiple times if necessary to resolve
        #   mid-air collisions.
        #
        #   REVISIT: It would be ideal to make this a regular block to
        #            the method, and that all works great...on Ruby 1.8.7 or
        #            later. In order to keep this working on 1.8.6,
        #            we had to make this take an explictly-created
        #            lambda Proc as a formal parameter.
        #

        #

    # Dynamically creates reader and writer methods for an attribute that

    # +key+::

    #                 if the attribute is not yet found in the stashed_hash.
    #                 Defaults to nil.
    #
    #     :type => If set to :boolean, then an accessor ending with a
    #              question mark is also created, which coerces the returend
    #              value to true or false. Values other than :boolean are
